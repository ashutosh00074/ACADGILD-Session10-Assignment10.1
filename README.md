Assignment: Implement a single screen using fragment.

Fragment 
-A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. 
-You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.
-You can think of a fragment as a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, 
-and which you can add or remove while the activity is running (sort of like a "sub activity" that you can reuse in different activities).

Problem Statement

-Implement a single screen using fragment

-a. Create an activity called MainActivity.java. Load the fragment SimpleAddition
-in MainActivity.

-b. Create a fragment called SimpleAddition.java. On a button click get a value from
-EditText and show it in TextView.
